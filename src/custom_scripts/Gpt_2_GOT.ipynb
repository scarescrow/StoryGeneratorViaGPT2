            " perhaps the answer, Harry thought desperately as the rest of them stood still, awaiting the light at the end of the door.   They had been looking forward to all of this, Harry, hoping that they could find something to discuss at last, and that they could all find a way to make something of the situation in the office, to the point where they had no choice but to decide if they would stay.   The door did open on the last visit to the office by the staff, which was the first opportunity to ask them the name of the boy who had passed away, so that they wouldn\\'t get any further questions about the subject.   He didn\\'t know his name, though, because he had not told them that he was gone, but they were certain that they saw him, or at least the truth, of what had happened. The other staff member was waiting outside the entrance to their office, her face a mixture of sweat and excitement.  \\'Yes, Harry.\\' was Harry\\'s low, raspy voice, as she hurried up Harry\\'s bed and sat down at the window.  \\'Did anything happen to you when we were away? How many of you could we give up, that\\'s all? We\\'re supposed to talk about a Death Eater? Come and meet us, Potter, and I\\'ll take a look.\\'  She turned and walked away with Harry.  He heard himself go to get to the door, thinking about his own life again, and he wondered if he had missed something.  He left his office door wide open. He could see the house of the Seer, and his house. He took off his cloak and tried to pull his eyes from the ceiling for any signs of ghosts. The windows were rippling with shadows. His fingers gripped all his robes and sat in the dark.   They were trying to get through the office as best as they could, but it had taken a long time, as it was difficult to keep a watchful eye close to the door in which the Seer had gone. Hermione and Viktor Dementor hadn\\'t found a single one of the staff, but there were voices in both voices.  The Ministry was out of it. Harry knew they were in for a terrible turn when they saw him standing in the corridor next to the door. He\\'d have been looking for a place to hide, to go and watch. Harry made a very loud click of fear, hoping, desperately, that they could hear whatever their voices were about, so that he could hear the last word, of the Ministry\\'s presence.  \\'Come in, Harry, there\\'s a voice.\\'  Harry looked outside, and as he did so he felt more than a little sad. When he could not look into them, he could do nothing but stare, so that he would be alone, because he knew it was coming, as the only way to get through the walls and back. The next morning, he and his friends were going through the door, they were having their first chat.  The Ministry was not listening to his mind, but he knew it would be difficult to break their silence with a single word, so Harry followed the sound of them passing through the door.  He could hear the Ministry\\'s shouts for help in their hut.  And they would be right outside when he and Viktor got there. A second voice was saying \"Where will we be heading?\"   A third voice was saying \"\"Hosko!\"  Harry looked away, and the fourth voice was saying \"Potter\\'s Headache!\"  As the third voice passed through the door, Harry heard it again coming through the windows and doors. The second and third voices were still talking. The first had been shouting for help and Harry saw the Minister of Magic looking up at them, and in a flash, it was the Minister\\'s House, standing at the edge of the room.  \\'You, Viktor Dementor, are in a Hall of Prophecy, Sirius\\'s House.\\'   Harry looked into the room, but knew perfectly well where Sirius lay, and he knew that they needed him to be there. But in Harry\\'s world, Sirius\\'s House was a place filled with people who needed help. They were not the mere ghosts of the Ministry.   He could see a few more people in the House, but it looked as though the door might lead them only to the front. There were too many seats in the room. The House was all packed, and many of them were sleeping. Harry had tried desperately to be as close as possible to Sirius, but it was too late, as the Ministry\\'s presence was already on the way.  \\'You left the house already, were you?\\'  \\'Yes, I did.\\'  \\'Harry, you\\'re coming alone.\\'  \\'Yes, I can\\'s the way you\\'d like,\\'\n",

They might not be the same as before, I don\\'t know, really. . . .\"  \"No, it will be all right,\" said Professor Sprout, \"all right . . .  .  It is always good to know when there are new opportunities to work.  The Dark Mark was a powerful force in the wizarding world, and with a bit of luck it might find a home.  But, if there is one thing we know about it, that is unlikely to emerge by chance for many years, and it is very difficult to find the people who would like their own magical descendants back in Azkaban.  A great many families have joined the Order since the Dementors arrived at Hogwarts.  But of them, only Professor Sprout has ever used a wand.\" Professor Sprout looked up at Professor McGonagall and Professor McGonagall\\'s hair. She gave Professor Sprout the name ''Professor Sprout\\'s Mother\\'s Curse.\"  \"She\\'s gone and she\\'s got another wand, she\\'s got another family. And she\\'s got one hundred and ninety-seven more, which are really small, really weak ones and really stupid little ones and they don\\'t work because they aren\\'t trained properly. The best ones are pretty tough and the ones that do work are very strong. They were at our school and they took their eyes off the wand. And it worked. The family\\'s back on the farm this year, and we\\'ve got a hundred and sixteen more and they\\'ve started to send out the letters. I think it\\'s quite good and I think the letters will be very useful. . . .\"  \"Very good, very good,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"Thank you, Harry.\" Professor McGonagall\\'s ears opened.  \"Thanks for the offer.\"  But before they could continue with the conversation, some of the Slytherins left the bar and headed back up to the common room. Professor McGonagall opened the door and left the room.  \"So, Harry, we\\'ve really enjoyed it tonight, but we have to tell you that the Gryffindor team -\" \"Good luck, Harry!\"  Harry, Hermione, and Ginny followed him out of the common room. Hermione was carrying her daughter Fleur\\'s purse.  \"I was wondering if you could give us a few minutes and tell us if you ever saw one of your own, please,\" Ginny muttered after the Slytherins left the bar, but she still kept throwing her arms around her, which was now a huge, hairy, warty mess and had not yet shrunk into a puddle and began walking up toward the common room.  \"Look!\" she said in a way that made Harry instantly jump.  \"Look!\" she added, \"Hermione, Hermione!  You\\'ve gone in the wrong direction, have you, Harry?\"  Harry could not see clearly who was talking to whose son, but Hermione did. In the last couple of weeks, her ears had shrunk.  \"Hermione, Hermione,\" Harry said with his usual carelessness, \"I know it won\\'t work as intended. . . .\"  But there she was, sitting comfortably on the edge of the common room table, watching over her daughter and muttering cheerfully to herself, Hermione.  She was lying in the arms of the great giant, who was wearing a head scarf so large it looked as though it had been stretched across her face.  There was no mistaking it and there was no mistaking the shape of the gigantic wizard. The very shape of Voldemort was holding his wand up in his hand as the gargoyle swung its wand up high to see where Hermione stood. Hermione was sitting straight. She wasn\\'t smiling.  \"You know, it would be nice if we could see you -\"  \"You know it could make a difference in the matter of your injuries, Harry,\" said the giant. \"They could just as well be looking around for us... I think it\\'s just going to be a little bit more natural for\n",

            " what we do. . . . \\'  It is not to be forgotten that we are not trying to be polite to you. You will not complain. There are people who do not wish to work for you, as they can get jobs in the game, and you are the only one who can be expected to do homework, so we hope you can return to the field this weekend.  Harry and Ron were talking for hours about what he ought to do next against the Quaffle, then decided on the sound of their voices. They could not do anything except keep coming. Harry\\'s mind went blank at this point. The way he\\'d looked in the mirror, it was perfectly normal for Voldemort to be wearing a pair of dark glasses.  \\'All right, all right, Harry!\\' Hermione called excitedly through the gap behind Harry and Ron. \\'We\\'re going to win. We\\'ve gotta win. Come on - . .  And then the bell rang.  \\'Come on! Let\\'s go!\\' Ron called, pulling Harry along behind the wall. As he stepped out of the mirror and into the field, they saw a huge white figure looming over his left hand.  \\'It\\'s the wizard! That\\'s him!\\'  Hermione took a step towards Harry and hugged him tightly. \\'What did you do?\\'  \\'I don\\'t remember! I\\'m just telling him what I\\'m seeing!\\'  But they weren\\'t alone. Nearly everybody else with him was now standing between him and the wizard, and were talking louder than Harry had ever heard them talking before. Harry was the third person to be separated from Voldemort this season. This was the third time this night he had felt the way he had supposed, and this, as much by the fact that his feelings were growing even weaker before the bell ran again, was no small tragedy.  \\'I\\'ve just been wondering - \\'  That was enough to make Hermione give the girl an ugly look. \\'What are you doing?\\'  \\'Nothing!\\' said Harry blankly, but he had forgotten. The feeling inside him, like the burning inside all around him, was that he looked, and indeed, he felt, horribly wrong. Then he saw Draco Malfoy, the black-haired wizard with long, thin glasses, who was standing very close to him.  \\'What\\'s happened?\\' Harry repeated.  Malfoy smiled. \\'If you don\\'t turn yourself in, then you\\'ll be expelled from the school. We\\'re going to make you work for us.\\'  \\'What are we going to do with Malfoy?\\' Harry asked loudly. \\'No, of course not! The best way out is to leave the whole stadium at once, but as soon as you\\'ve come out of the entrance room we\\'re going to run for that wall - \\'  \\'Why?\\' Harry said hastily.  \\'Because you\\'ve got no idea what was going on at that place,\\' said Malfoy.  \\'Of course not!\\' Harry said quietly.  Malfoy seemed a bit confused, but was rather determined to talk. With a sort of sense of calmness he told Harry he was about to hear what he had seen inside the Pensieve. He had heard that Malfoy was about to do something he had never done before in his life.  \\'You mean - do you think you can see - see - how far - how soon - what\\'s the - the - \\' Ron glanced behind him at the two-headed Ravenclaw dragon, staring at it intently.  \\'It\\'s all off we don\\'t know!\\'  \\'Oh right.\\'  So the next thing they knew the whole crowd was making their way back up the side of the stadium, so that Harry could face them, but without moving.  They could hear the silence from the Great Hall, and it was so much louder than it looked.  It was going to be a difficult match. There was one thing every student was going to do best, and that was to take a few extra points off their Hogwarts points, even if they missed any. A win was going to make these chances all the easier.  Harry\\'s stomach sank. He was going to say this, that, in spite of what some people in the crowd were saying, Malfoy had no desire to be expelled from Hogwarts. He was going to have to fight so hard, to demonstrate his loyalty to Malfoy. Malfoy had taken the fight very carefully, so that Harry wasn\\'t likely to win anything by beating him.  \\'I wasn\\'t going to win the match, Malfoy!\\' he snarled. \\'I was going to be expelled! I was going to be expelled! I couldn\\'t have won this fight! I could\\'t have beaten anyone! I\\'ll miss them! I\\'ll miss - \\'  \\'It isn\\'t the end, Harry! You are going to\n",

            " . . . . \\'\\'He\\'s supposed to be an Animagus, as you can imagine -\\'\\'Yeah, he is -\\' asked Ron. \\'No, he\\'s not . . .\\'\\'You\\'re not an Animagus . . .\\'\\'He\\'s not angry, of course,\\' said Hermione. \\'I\\'d say something like, he just wants to die . . .\\'\\'If he\\'s going to have to,\\' said Harry darkly and with conviction, \\'I know he should come with me and find out how to work the body out, because he\\'ll never come clean.\\'\\'Yes, he\\'s going to be angry at me,\\' said Hermione. \\'And . . . no . . .\\'\\'I like the idea of you coming to my funeral...\\'\\'\\'Malfoy told\\'\\'\\' him, not that he wanted to tell a story,\\' said Harry. \\'I like it . . . \\'\\'Malfoy, it is too tragic . . .\\'\\'We might find out how to kill it,\\' said Harry, trying to hide his excitement at his own death- at the sight of Harry\\'s face. Hermione was still very surprised. \\'What if he keeps muttering about how I was killed?\\'\\'Yes,\\' said Harry. \\'Yes, I think they\\'ll think he\\'s lying, too.\\'\\'I just want a bit of comfort,\\' said Hermione. \\'I don\\'t hate him, of course - he likes to think I was a wizard, of course,\\'\\'\\'Malfoy will never know - he might be going to bed thinking he likes me even more.\\'\\'Don\\'t be alarmed,\\' said Ron, with a smile. \\'He\\'s quite right.\\'\\'Well, it\\'s time,\\' said Hermione. \\'Have you got anything to do, or is he going to come with you?\\'\\'D\\'you know when he says \\'yes?\\'\\'I have been to Dumbledore,\\' said Harry, \\'and I have told him what I saw there, though . . .\\'Harry, when we\\'ve done, and we\\'re supposed to be going to see the Death Eaters, I don\\'t know how the Death Eaters are going to know we\\'re there, and I don\\'t think they would care if you got away.\\'\\'Who cares if you stay at Hogwarts?\\' asked Ron. \\'If Voldemort has something to hide - Harry - what will they worry about?\\'\\'Do whatever you like,\\' said Harry, and he stood there, still. When he said it, he was not looking at Hermione; he was looking up at the ceiling, as though expecting to see a gigantic body, so thin it was almost invisible. For a moment, he felt the very strangeness in his scarlight, and then, as though waiting for a light stroke from Voldemort, he looked back at a picture of Ron, who was smiling at him, who was standing in the dark corridor, looking at a painting of Harry, Hermione, and Neville on the wall.\\'You\\'re going to the Burrow?\\' said Harry, and he bent forward a little, thinking of something else; he kept his eyes fixed, the whole time looking at Snape in the hospital wing - and how he should use the potion to clear the way for the Death Eaters to come back.  He didn\\'t know why, at the time. He had not thought much of Dumbledore at all; he had not spoken to him, he had not seen him at all since the night of their return. He could not understand why Dumbledore was not going to see them, but at the moment he had come to the conclusion it was impossible; the Ministry had been trying very hard to persuade Snape to do his bidding, and he was desperate to make his case to the Death Eaters that he was in charge; it was no longer on their terms and no longer illegal.  Now he was feeling really good and it was going to be a much longer journey to clear out the maze. He could still use the potion; he would be able to tell them that he was at the right place at the right time ... the way they thought Snape was. So he took the picture and started down the corridor to his bedroom.  The front door was open and a loud banging sounded behind him. He opened it and took off. Harry watched Ron and Hermione, standing in the bedroom doorway in their common-room, looking around curiously.  Something very unusual was happening here: the bedroom window had been flung open. They could barely see it. Harry was able to see a very black figure moving in and out of it (there was a long pause), but the room was barely more than a foot from the bed. Harry noticed Harry looking around his own half-lighted room as though he didn\\'t have much space left. \n",

Fred moved over to the side and shook his head, a great deal to Ron\\'s shock, said, \"You\\'re stupid, Ron. Don\\'t be stupid.\"  Hermione, who was lying on her back, looked up from her meal by her usual length of rope-dyed legs.  \"Come on, Hermione, I\\'m hungry!\" she said, and they all left the hall with her without the slightest effort.  At the top of the stairs they reached Grawp. Fred, George, Fred, Ron, and Hermione moved over to where he stood with his head set beside Ron.  \"That\\'s Ginny\\'s body,\" said Fred, peering around out of his slit-cheeked glasses. The Fat Lady looked shocked; she did not look like Ginny at first, but soon became much, much more friendly. \"No, it\\'s still very warm here,\" she told Harry, who laughed in surprise.  \"So you\\'ve been here since day one?\"  \"Aye,\" said Harry, grinning.  \"Have you heard about us?\"  \"You know, I was on the train when I heard the doors opened, \" Ron muttered impatiently. \"It was about ten o\\'clock in the evening, you remember, but I was supposed to be downstairs - the door was supposed to be to the office -\"  But Harry was quite sure he\\'d already heard about the office - and it was full of odd, ragged figures, even if Harry looked away, and he could hear voices upstairs.  But nobody else answered.  But all they heard were Hermione\\'s footsteps, all passing through the door over the top of Grawp\\'s head.  \"What\\'s that?\"  Grawp looked as blank as ever now, except where a large chunk of his face had gone through.  \"You know that time at school when she wasn\\'t supposed to be there?\" said Fred heavily.  \"She got a lot of homework and her sister never got any! She got to be there all the time, she went all the time!\"  So that\\'s it!\" shouted Grawp, who had just turned to walk away from the crowd. \"And you, the Fat Lady, you don\\'t get the memo about the school, do you?\"  \"I\\'ve got no money,\" said Ron, \"because she left my letter at home!\"  \"You haven\\'t told them about that, do you?\"  \"No I haven\\'t asked you,\" said Fred, the grin growing even wider on his face. \"You know what that letter said: you are the master of the school, I am the master! I can\\'t believe it\\'s written in my mother\\'s handwriting.\"  \"Hermione, I said I\\'m going to tell her, I\\'ve got to tell her!\"  \"Why should you?\" said Fred, his eyebrows raised.  \"Because she wants it back, don\\'t she?\"  Ron hesitated. \"She doesn\\'t want it back. She\\'s just not interested in it. It\\'s not her fault!\"  \"Well, she doesn\\'t seem to hate me at all, at all,\" said Fred.  Hermione looked at him through her large, sunken eyes.  \"Harry, the Fat Lady never told her that you\\'d found out what Dumbledore was planning!\"  \"She didn\\'t know how to get involved with the Ministry of Magic before I came here!\" said Ron, frowning. \"Even the Ministry does have it!\"  \"If Dumbledore is planning to use me against you, you wouldn\\'t want that, wouldn\\'t you? You know what Dumbledore\\'s about to do, anyway!\"  \"I\\'m not mad!\" Ron screamed at the sound of Ron\\'s own words. \"It would be great if he just let me out of my way if he needs me, but - I don\\'t think Dumbledore wants me back at the place that I live!\"  \"Why?\" said Ginny nervously. \"Harry doesn\\'t trust Dumbledore. Dumbledore\\'s got to be all right with Grawp, and he\\'s a fool to get involved! Dumbledore\\'s got to do it, even though you\\'re\n",

            " over for a few moments, staring at the ceiling. The thing, however, fell silent, its eyes glued to Harry\\'s.  \"What?\" said Harry quickly. \"I didn\\'t notice that at all - I just wondered what\\'s going on upstairs.\"  \"But...but you were here in Hogsmeade,\" said Hermione.  \"Yeah,\" said Harry, with a great deal of excitement. \"Hermione, what\\'s up with the Weasleys?\"  \"D\\'you tell her?\"  \"We\\'ll come with her if she\\'s with us. Come on, hurry up -\"  They climbed the stairs and up the marble staircase into the living room. Hagrid was standing in the doorway to the window, examining a small package that looked quite familiar.  \"What\\'s this?\" he said.  I\\'m sorry,\" said Harry. Hagrid looked slightly crestfallen. \"Why don\\'t you come in here or it will help -\"  \"No,\" said Harry quickly.  But no - he looked at the envelope. It was wrapped tightly in a thick piece of lettering. It said \\'Hags\\' handwriting.\\'  He opened it and put it into his pocket to read it instead.  \"This is my present.\"  It was a photograph and the word \"Harry\", which had been written in the topmost corner of the envelope, was clearly written in a clear, white vertical line.  \"No.\"  Harry went back inside, looking around; the window was now filled with a very strange sort of eerie light. He pulled open his trunk, peered through the window, and saw the first sign of Ron in the room.  His heart was pounding very fast. It was the only present he had - and he wasn\\'t telling anybody.  \"No?\" he said, sounding a little worried. \"I can\\'t tell you where it is!\"  And the picture burst into a loud burst. It was an elderly woman in a long pink dress holding a small book and two silver wands, pointing her bow at Ron\\'s present.  \"Hermione!\"  It was Hermione, standing at the window, glaring at Hermione and looking at the letter. Ron had just moved through the doorway to the door.  \"Hermione,\" said Harry, and she was so much taller than all the people in the room, Ron was barely taller than the second-busier of them. \"I thought she was okay with you?\"  \"Oh yeah, I was,\" said Ron. \"She\\'s been so kind to keep me company... you know . . . well...\"  At that moment, a storm of sparks was coming from the end of Harry\\'s wand, illuminating the window.  He looked down at it with a mixture of surprise and pity.  \"Oh yeah... I\\'d reckon she\\'s been a bit nicer with you in the house now... but no, no, I didn\\'t want to hang around after this.\"  He looked down at the letter, though to his relief it didn\\'t say anything. That could have been because he was so angry - but also because, to his disappointment, the letter never mentioned Ron. A few seconds later, Ron\\'s eyes were on the letter again.  \"Didn\\'t mean to say you know who I am,\" he said.  \"Well,\" said Harry quickly. \"Listen to what\\'s going on upstairs.\"  The room was suddenly full of an awful kind of noise.  \"This was my present last time out of here,\" said Ron grimly.  \"What\\'s wrong with this, then?\"  \"It\\'s not my car,\" said Ron. \"It\\'s my cat -\"  Then, almost immediately, flames erupted from the end of Harry\\'s wand, shooting from it everywhere.  \"That\\'s not the end of it at all,\" said Harry harshly. \"This has been my present ever since I was a baby. You\\'re going to have your old things out there for me. I\\'ll be glad if you don\\'t burn it.\"  \"I\\'ll be happy if you don\\'t let anyone else in here!\"  \"But - you\\'re telling me - it\\'s all yours.\"  Harry thought for a moment, then said, \"Oh my gosh,\" and shook his head miserably. It was a very unusual sort of noise. The moment that came around, he felt a little like an enormous cat shivering. They weren\\'t alone. They weren\\'t leaving the house, are they? But what if he really wanted to use something of his own? He didn\\'t want the fire all to himself - he hated what more he could get to it.  \"It\\'ll hang on to it - come on, Harry!\" he said. He reached out and pulled out a few bits of gold and silver\n",

            " looked at the ceiling, and said,  \\'D\\'you think they\\'re looking at me like that?\\'  The door was flung open; the three Death Eaters had gathered around the fire, ready to make whatever attack was imminent. But before they could do anything, however, one of his fellows had said, \\'Expecto patronum!\\'  The doorbell rang noisily and Harry and Hermione exchanged looks: Harry saw Malfoy coming up the front steps, waving his wand, as though he was about to strike. Seconds later, Neville entered, but there was nothing but a loud rumbling and scraping of the surrounding crowd - he could hear Hermione\\'s voice too - he sprinted up the last stairs, Neville, coming too.  \\'I think we\\'re about to get into Hogwart\\'s,\\' whispered Hermione as Neville dashed along the last few steps. It was almost midnight; Hermione had to wade down the back of the carriage to find anyone outside it.  He led Harry and Ron out onto the front steps and closed the door behind them as he went, so that nobody heard the footsteps. In an hour or so, people were hurrying to watch when they reached the top of the castle. Harry, Ron and Hermione followed, staring up at the top of the tower ceiling.  The sky was becoming much more spectacular here; it was quite pitch black now and people made many dives through the canopy of clouds in the direction of Hagrid\\'s house. By midafternoon the sky had become very bright and clear. All the people watching knew that Hagrid was still inside Hogwarts. On the other side of the castle, meanwhile ,the Hogwarts Express was coming down from the coast, passing just behind Hogwart\\'s and Whomping Willow. Harry did not dare look up, but knew that people were still in Hogwart\\'s and Whomping Willow to witness it.  \\'We don\\'t want to be late,\\' said Hermione in a flat voice, as she and Harry emerged into the station at lunchtime. \\'We don\\'t want to be late - \\'  \\'Er - what\\'s up?\\'  Harry\\'s stomach gave a huge jolt. He had almost forgotten the Dursleys would be coming into the station at lunchtime - Hermione had told him about that; she had told him about her meeting her parents at the start-of-term feast.  He could hear Hermione looking nervously around for her trunk. He looked back around. Hedwig was nowhere to be seen. He had just seen her walking down the front steps in the garden and now she was standing there in front of the twins\\' dormitories.  \\'I didn\\'t know who was in there, I shouldn\\'t have - \\'  \\'Oh, really?\\' said Hermione. \\'How long is it going to be till it lights us up?\\'  \\'Well, it\\'ll be about an hour and a half,\\' said Ron tentatively.  \\'But if it gets into the Great Hall then we\\'ve got to leave, we\\'ve got to - \\' Hermione whispered.  \\'Oh yeah?\\' said Harry darkly. \\'Don\\'t worry, dear, we won\\'t be having too much fun. I can walk up to the twins\\' dormitories alone, I know how to - \\'  They were hurrying up the stairs, Harry saw, though they had not expected to see Ron and Hermione in time either, so he got down onto the carriage-side platform. It was deserted; it was now dark outside. He knew that Hermione had not arrived yet, but that was a good sign for her.  They reached the Hogwart\\'s Whomping Willow in the distance, glimpsed glimpses of Hagrid coming down upon them. They skirted between the trees for miles, searching for the source of the noises. The whole group made short work of them as they pulled on the Invisibility Cloak and headed back up the steps into the grounds.  \\'Good afternoon!\\' said Ron, when everyone had left the station. \\'I would like a word to Professor Flitwick about our journey.\\'  She did not answer; she was turning to Harry and looking at him curiously.  \\'About what - what happened?\\'  \\'What happened?\\'  \\'Did something happen?\\'  \\'I don\\'t know, but I think we\\'re going to be in trouble if we get too close to him!\\'  Ron looked rather alarmed. \\'Have a look around! We were there at lunchtime, couldn\\'t we\\'ve got in? He needs to come down, we don\\'t want to be spotted here - \\'  \\'I\\'ve found out you can carry -\\'  It was a funny silence. Harry was getting the impression that Hermione was still quite keen to help him.  Neville, on the other hand, seemed to have stopped being so keen to\n",

The very last thing they wanted to do was have one of their top brass sacked, so it wasn\\'t a long-awaited breakthrough here. Harry and Harry\\'s face was very visible under his father\\'s face, there was a clear expression of great affection on his face as he watched him.  \\'It was someone from the Death Eaters, I think, trying to steal my autobiography!\\'  \\'Why aren\\'t you telling me it was my dad?\\' Harry asked slowly.  \\'My dad\\'s in Azkaban!\\' he said quickly, his eyes rolling. \\'I really don\\'t know how you got there, Harry. I only knew him when he was on my dad\\'s side. Anyway, the Death Eaters are taking a bit of trouble to stop those who try to hurt them.\\'  There had been a loud crack.  \\'They\\'ve got the record!\\'  \\'Well, there\\'s no point playing games,\\' said Harry, his voice trembling slightly. \\'It\\'s never fun, you know. I think they think I did a great job and then I hurt them and I ended up in Azkaban!\\'  \\'You say Harry didn\\'t kill somebody if it was your dad,\\' said Harry, in a feeble imitation of Filch.  \\'Yeah, it was!\\' said Filch. \\'I just thought maybe your mum would still like you out of her house.\\'  \\'Anyway, this was my son\\'s friend Lucius Malfoy,\\' said Harry, \\'and the Death Eaters sent a spy out to catch your dad.\\'  Then there was another loud crash.  \\'What happened to the book?\\' Harry asked, trying hard not to let his voice crack.  \\'It came back!\\' said Filch, still beaming. \\'I think Lucius Malfoy was the one who tipped off us!\\'  \\'I was the one trying to catch him!\\' said Harry. \\'And you managed to snatch out a book on wizards by accidentally throwing it into the river. A very lucky charm!\\'  \\'Oh, they\\'re not even in school, you just threw in your book,\\' said Filch. \\'I\\'ve sent an owl to them and I think you managed to get out some things you don\\'t want.\\'  \\'How did your book get a bird into the river? Did they get your book?\\'  \\'Yes, but they can\\'t get my book unless there are certain conditions!\\'  \\'But,\\' said Harry in a voice tremulous, \\'but there are conditions they couldn\\'t get mine?\\'  \\'No,\\' said Filch.  \\'It was only because they took too much time,\\' said Harry, stunned. \\'Not because they were scared. If they\\'d only thought you\\'d try something stupid , then maybe they\\'d have thought you ought to try something stupid!\\'  At this, Filch\\'s voice broke into a shout of indignation. \\'Well, I can\\'t think of ANYTHING stupid for a book that\\'s only about dragons and dragons and you\\'ve just had to try a dozen different things on it!\\'  \\'All the same, Harry, if you really want someone to try a load of things, I\\'m the only one who can!\\' said Harry, in a voice shaking uncontrollably. \\'And I\\'ll tell you a few of them . . . and they\\'ll want to take advantage of you!\\'  \\'Mum -\\'  Filch was still beaming very heartily, \\'You\\'re the best person I\\'ve ever met!\\'  \\'I\\'m getting better!\\'  \\'It really is!\\'  Filch\\'s voice now rang out like a bell: His father was dying, you were in the wrong house!\\'  \\'Don\\'t let your father\\'s son die!\\'  \\'I\\'m getting stronger, please!\\' said Harry so loudly that everyone laughed.  Filch\\'s voice was shaking worse than ever again. He sounded as though he could throw up. \\'Mums are so stupid, Harry!\\'  \\'What on earth d\\'you think that\\'s going to happen to you?\\'  \\'You\\'\n",

            " be happy for me to make it, I\\'ll find a nice, clean shaven, well-placed wardrobe. And I\\'m going to the hospital wing after the holidays. No . . . no one\\'s going to be able to find me, and if Harry could have . . . if I ever get back . . .\\'And that, Harry, is hardly the most inspiring of explanations. When he had been told of his father\\'s demise four years previously, he had been devastated but relieved, yet he hoped, in the end, that the Dark Mark would never resurface again, although his father certainly had his reasons for wishing it. He had no proof, therefore, of its power beyond a small window at the bottom of the castle\\'s marble staircase; for those who knew him best had said that Voldemort had indeed killed him; they believed that, judging by his many faults together, he would have been much easier -\\'He had hoped that, at the end of term, he would move onwards, with Dumbledore, to become the first headmaster of Hogwarts, but none of the other heads of house would have dared to say so, for he could not live with the fact that so many of the wizarding families now believed him. Nevertheless, he did not return to Hogwarts this year, although he could not pretend that he did not feel a slight superiority to the Dark Lord\\'s knowledge of his deathly secrets, and that, to his great satisfaction, this was due not to the knowledge of those secrets, but to the fact that he could have been certain that they were real too.Harry sat in the tent in the middle of the night, contemplating Death - the dark, cruel, and horrible world that awaited him now, a world that would surely not befall him unless he broke this promise - Harry had just glimpsed what was lurking deep below the surface of this place, an unbreakable barrier. His mind, however, was not in the zone of certainty. The Dark Lord was not yet within the boundaries of the curse that Voldemort had conjured at Sirius Black, but he might still be in the position of having to explain why Sirius was there and why he had vanished without a trace. Nevertheless, at their last moment, Harry felt a little sick. He was not the only one who was having problems with the Dark Lord now, but even so, the only one who was having problems at the present moment was Voldemort, whom Harry knew very little about. He was still waiting for Dumbledore to return once more before announcing the end of his time with the Order; his heart was at a standstill yet, though he could not imagine why. Then, on the very last day, there had been a storm of curses upon the deserted grounds, the first such attack yet inflicted upon any dwelling in the grounds. For almost a quarter of the last fortnight, Harry had not made any effort to discover the source of what had started it all, but now seemed to find it harder to concentrate upon the task at hand.It was not, of course, the usual rush of despair, for all those who seemed unable to see what was really going on seemed to be seeing nothing, for for whatever they might have seen was all too real. The darkness ahead was indeed overwhelming, though perhaps it was not yet quite gone: Only glimpses of the distant blackness remained, the outlines of the monstrous, black-figured dragons, and the streaks of green that were the night air. What was that thing that was keeping the watchers from seeing what was happening beneath the dark sky, and what was it that was making it happen? Had it sensed the darkness? Had it sensed it? Had it died? If it did, then it would not only be able to hear what was going on below, but also to see what was happening in front of time, which would mean that it was there, waiting, waiting, listening, waiting...\\'That\\'s right,\\' whispered Mr Weasley, as he had never, and yet that was what he had felt like every time he had been out in the darkness.\\'?Dobby,\\' said Harry, \\'Dobby would have expected me, would have thought you were there,\\' he repeated grudgingly. \\'Yeah, the Death Eaters were going down, wouldn\\'t have been so happy after all. I expect they\\'ve changed their minds, they\\'ll be here for a while.\\'Now, he tried to remain as casual as possible, but before he had finished, his voice carried on through the silence.\\'Somebody had managed to get you to do something for them, someone\\'s been writing or sending messages to you - \\'Dobby, what was that?\\' asked Harry.\\'No idea,\\' said Dobby quietly. \\'They thought Voldemort would be happy because they were giving him his information.\\'\\'If they did that,\\' muttered Harry, watching Dobby closely, \\'you could have blown up the Ministry of Magic!\\'D\n",

            " moment; there was nothing he could do for Hermione. He was too busy pretending to be a hundred points better than Harry himself; he was on the verge of telling Ron about Voldemort, for instance, but Harry had not yet recounted the story, and Ron\\'s hand was clutching the back of his jeans as he spoke, trying to force himself to sleep, but things took a strange -\"SIRIUS!\"'  But Ron couldn\\'t wake up, because he had forgotten. He got up, his hands shaking, but Hermione\\'s hand didn\\'t seem to have broken away from Ron\\'s. The door of the bathroom creaked open, and Harry recognized Ron\\'s, rather small, dark eyes; they were bright, square, and deadly serious.  \"How are you?\" said Ron, as they slipped through the door and sank in again. \"What\\'s happening?\"  \"This time\" said Hermione, looking shocked. \"You\\'re going to the Ministry.\"  She pointed her wand at the door frame. It burst open. They found themselves standing beside the old statue in a courtyard, its rusted frame swaying as if it was knocked off its feet. There was something heavy and gray about its skin: It\\'s skin was much too young.  Their feet hit the floor. It was a tall man, pale and tawny in brown robes, the expression of a wizard casting shadows behind him. He was walking around a large table, and in front of him were seven large stone chandeliers: the brightest star in the constellation Draco, each with its own special shade of silvery magenta. The man had long, earthy gray hair, and wore long velvet shoes and a matching hat to keep him dry.  \"Oh, no,\" said Ron, \"you don\\'t fancy staying, do you, Hermione?\"  \"What d\\'you mean, staying?\"  \"I d\\'we thought they were going to come and get us,\" said Ron.  There was a sudden clatter on the floor. Several of the creatures around Ron\\'s had fallen silent - they\\'d just been thrown into the chandelier and a great lolloping insect came flying out from under them.  \"D\\'you want to get rid of it by me, boy? Get rid of it, too?\" Ron whispered to Hermione, and with a little pop, a large egg sprang to life on Ron\\'s arm.  Harry, Ron, and Hermione set off for the dark passage without knowing it, passing the portrait of the Fat Lady in Hagrid\\'s house when the sun came out, and closed the door behind them so tightly that it seemed impossible that they might fall across its hanging wings. The room was so far dark that even if something had been going on in it, it was impossible to see where it was going. Harry, Ron, and Hermione walked along the stone steps into the hallways and out of sight from one room to the other until the lamps dimmed and dark wood benches rose high above them, and then silence fell. At the foot of the stairs, they found themselves descending to the staircase that led to the four-legged stool. The stool had been made of stone and was made of solid stone, and Harry had never seen it crumble before.  To Harry\\'s enormous relief, the topmost stool had disappeared, replaced by four large, feathery stool with large golden stars and nine tiny, slanting stones.  \"Aren\\'t you supposed to tell my mum that?\" Harry asked Hermione politely, looking over at the oldest stool with its large golden crown on it.  \"I\\'ve never seen anything like it,\" said Hermione, sitting down. \"Oh, don\\'t talk to me like that. If I ask her, she\\'d have to be really good about me telling her I\\'m going to Hogwarts, it\\'s just too obvious.\"  The stool fell to the floor, but the benches still stood high above them. Ron took one of the benches in between the two benches, picked up the golden stool, and placed it in a little bag on top, as he was sure he\\'d forgotten his glasses, and thought quickly - what if they fell off?  Then, without warning, Harry saw something moving beyond anything he had ever seen before in his life. A large, round stone pillar had risen out of the surface, and a long, thin rope had been cast across it, and a pair of eyes had grown out of the end.  Wondering if the stone was moving, Ron pulled all four legs out of the bag holding them and raised them to the light of a lamp that soared upward over the stones.  \"You\\'re supposed to tell my sister, look after her,\" said Hermione, reaching for her wand. \"It can\\'t hurt to tell her you\\'re feeling ill.\"  Ron, meanwhile, pulled his small round handbag toward the stool, smoothed it in his\n",

            ". They followed him up a dark, winding, wooded path, until there was a sharp bend in a hillside where the light of two long, dark headlights had suddenly gone out.  \"How did they hear it?\" Harry asked, crossing the picket fence.  \"Out in the dark stuff, Harry,\" said Hermione, staring at the dark trees and shrubs resting upon a dark black root with a sour, shrewd eye. \"Whiteness matters a great deal.\"  \"Of course,\" said Harry, staring around him, trying to see what he could find. \"Oh, come on. Whose tree are they on?\"  The trees and shrubs were as green as old Douglas fir.  \"That\\'s a house-elf,\" said Hermione. \"Because I\\'ve been setting house-elves free.\"  \"And you passed Harry over a tree,\" Harry mumbled, jogging across the threshold, \"and I freaked out at the elf\\'s sitting by it, Dobby almost hit you on the tail.\"  \"I\\'m trying to get a lot of house-elves to get into the next house, Harry, I\\'ve got him at my house and he\\'ll come overnight --\"  \"Come all the way out of here if you\\'re dropping eves,\" said Hermione scornfully, holding up a large rock.  Harry took a broomstick high to keep it up, didn\\'t stride alone like Ron did, and set off in a swirl of green smoke. He edged nearer and nearer the thick ring of houses in the distance.  Soon they passed an enormous oak with a boarded-up stationery shop. Herringbone and sapphires and flagstone hang around it; and there -- near the top of the hill, perched on a belch -- a small brick where he and Ron had once grazed by a venetian bull, both enclosed in nothing but charred butchers. The bright lights next to them were so close he almost ducked out of sight, his mind set on some horrible story while all around him rose into the atmosphere like tiny ghosts, either dancing around, waiting to see who might show up or watching their parents steal their hearts before descending into a very pitiful sleep.  \"Mischief, Mischief,\" he whispered to the shadowy ceiling. \"You\\'ve just gone in there without permission. Look. Then back to the spot -- if it\\'s custard, it\\'s custard.\n",

            "  \"Come on lads,\" she said.  \"Hey, Harry! Hermione -\"  \"What? You dressed like that squirrelly prefect?\"  \"Yeah - it was a baby Fred and George asked me to give them in!\"  Ron and Hermione both snapped at Hermione, cutting their way around him.  \"He\\'s raving about Dumbledore!\" Ron whispered. \"Didn\\'t you talk to him?\"  \"No,\" Hermione said, making it very difficult to get away on a broomstick as she looked terrified.  \"Do what?\"  \"Lead him.\"  \"Get away from him,\" Ron whispered. \"We\\'ve broken up!\"  They had barely got near the entrance hall when a second female companion came around and beckoned a bushy black girl with long, pigmented hair.  \"Thanks for coming, Harry,\" she said faintly to the twins, \"but I heard someone slip out.. . Everyone in the school is laughing.... \"  Harry and Ron turned; every face in the hall was turned toward them.  \"I\\'m going to the Hall to see Fudge!\" shouted Hermione, hurrying forward to give him some help. \"Hermione, you saw what happened with the Daily Prophet,they didn\\'t cover it in detail! Haven\\'t had time to gather all the facts yet, but who cares if the Prophet was a cover for witchcraft -\"  \"Oh yeah, this is what it\\'s like to put a man on trial!\" shouted Ron as she seized his bag. \"Had an ideal moment last night on the High Street under the headline about You-Know-\\'s-Name-nineteen and Fred and George grinning right into it.  v. END .  Harry looked around; the Slytherin table was already full.  \"Weve been told all this already!\" said Ron. \"But he\\'d be another truly innocent Bludger! Have we even got the truth about all this? Have Harry got the story  \"You think he\\'d do it himself?\" Hermione said firmly.  \"Are you telling the truth?\" said Harry lightly.  \"Of course he wouldn\\'t,\" said Hermione firmly.  \"Just say it,\" said Harry. When they had left him that question, Hermione turned red and got back up again.  \"But why? I\\'ve brought loads of stuff,\" she said finally, staring at Hermione. \"Of course Ron\\'s back -\"  \"\n",

            " before he interrupted again. \"How did you know I was watching your match?\" he said. \"You keep forgetting Peverell is in St Mungos -\"  \"I don\\'t pretend to know that information, yeh skulker. It\\'s a dis\\'advantage,\" said Hermione. \"Harry, you\\'ve got to take care of Peverells stuff. He won\\'t treat those complain abou\\' it. . . .\"  \"He\\'s not your worst enemy, is he, said Ron before Harry could answer. They\\'re teachers you can trust! So trust them if Occlumency survives him, keep them friendly, Harry, that\\'ll give you confidence. . . .  Ron bit down hard on his coffee as he ignored her, his mouth stretched with teeth. He wanted to ask him how he became a cert.... Too much like a brother to really know, he thought....But it was as though a hard, cold night, and the train was carrying him -- his ears went red, his fists clenched, he looked up at the dark circular compartment.  There was nobody there. He had disappeared out of sight and gone down an endless spiral staircase, spinning at fever pitch.  \\'Don\\'t tell that to him!\\' Ron whispered in Harry\\'s ear, and Harry couldn\\'t help thinking, thinking of what Rita, the broomstick, Harry, had been dreaming about.  Harry stood too long, his ears disbelieving, listening hard, listening hard to what he heard in the infernal room where the Invisibility Cloak was hovering, carefully guard . . .  .....  \"Quick in, quick out,\" said Rita Skeeter\\'s voice against the growing silence in the compartment.  Harry sat up quite straight as the cold, dark air in the toiletcase pointed toward the compartment door into the compartment on the first floor.  He had taken the stairs to the sunken landing and reached the landing, his knees pulling at his ankles. There was silence in the compartment as Ron told him to concentrate on getting back to the toilet; Hermione was still gaping at him, she whispered, \"What a gloopy journey! How much did it take to get there? Well done, Ron,\" she added, nodding toward her own briefcase.  It had been a very difficult journey. Harry\\'s skinny waist, pale eyes, pierced scarlet, had been torn open several times over.  The force of his own weight\n",
