       "'<i>(This article is derived from a talk given at the 2001 Franz\\nDeveloper Symposium.)\\n</i>\\n\\nIn the summer of 1995, my friend Robert Morris and I\\nstarted a startup called \\n<a href=\"http://docs.yahoo.com/docs/pr/release184.html\">Viaweb</a>.  \\nOur plan was to write\\nsoftware that would let end users build online stores.\\nWhat was novel about this software, at the time, was\\nthat it ran on our server, using ordinary Web pages\\nas the interface.\\n\\nA lot of people could have been having this idea at the\\nsame time, of course, but as far as I know, Viaweb was\\nthe first Web-based application.  It seemed such\\na novel idea to us that we named the company after it:\\nViaweb, because our software worked via the Web,\\ninstead of running on your desktop computer.\\n\\nAnother unusual thing about this software was that it\\nwas written primarily in a programming language called\\nLisp. It was one of the first big end-user\\napplications to be written in Lisp, which up till then\\nhad been used mostly in universities and research labs. [1]\\n\\n<b>The Secret Weapon</b>\\n\\nEric Raymond has written an essay called \"How to Become a Hacker,\"\\nand in it, among other things, he tells would-be hackers what\\nlanguages they should learn.  He suggests starting with Python and\\nJava, because they are easy to learn.  The serious hacker will also\\nwant to learn C, in order to hack Unix, and Perl for system\\nadministration and cgi scripts.  Finally, the truly serious hacker\\nshould consider learning Lisp:\\n<blockquote>\\n  Lisp is worth learning for the profound enlightenment experience\\n  you will have when you finally get it; that experience will make\\n  you a better programmer for the rest of your days, even if you\\n  never actually use Lisp itself a lot.\\n</blockquote>\\nThis is the same argument you tend to hear for learning Latin.  It\\nwon\\'t get you a job, except perhaps as a classics professor, but\\nit will improve your mind, and make you a better writer in languages\\nyou do want to use, like English.\\n\\nBut wait a minute.  This metaphor doesn\\'t stretch that far.  The\\nreason Latin won\\'t get you a job is that no one speaks it.  If you\\nwrite in Latin, no one can understand you.  But Lisp is a computer\\nlanguage, and computers speak whatever language you, the programmer,\\ntell them to.\\n\\nSo if Lisp makes you a better programmer, like he says, why wouldn\\'t\\nyou want to use it? If a painter were offered a brush that would\\nmake him a better painter, it seems to me that he would want to\\nuse it in all his paintings, wouldn\\'t he? I\\'m not trying to make\\nfun of Eric Raymond here.  On the whole, his advice is good.  What\\nhe says about Lisp is pretty much the conventional wisdom.  But\\nthere is a contradiction in the conventional wisdom:  Lisp will\\nmake you a better programmer, and yet you won\\'t use it.\\n\\nWhy not?  Programming languages are just tools, after all.  If Lisp\\nreally does yield better programs, you should use it.  And if it\\ndoesn\\'t, then who needs it?\\n\\nThis is not just a theoretical question.  Software is a very\\ncompetitive business, prone to natural monopolies.  A company that\\ngets software written faster and better will, all other things\\nbeing equal, put its competitors out of business.  And when you\\'re\\nstarting a startup, you feel this very keenly.  Startups tend to\\nbe an all or nothing proposition.  You either get rich, or you get\\nnothing.  In a startup, if you bet on the wrong technology, your\\ncompetitors will crush you.\\n\\nRobert and I both knew Lisp well, and we couldn\\'t see any reason\\nnot to trust our instincts and go with Lisp.  We knew that everyone\\nelse was writing their software in C++ or Perl.  But we also knew\\nthat that didn\\'t mean anything.  If you chose technology that way,\\nyou\\'d be running Windows.  When you choose technology, you have to\\nignore what other people are doing, and consider only what will\\nwork the best.\\n\\nThis is especially true in a startup.  In a big company, you can\\ndo what all the other big companies are doing.  But a startup can\\'t\\ndo what all the other startups do.  I don\\'t think a lot of people\\nrealize this, even in startups.\\n\\nThe average big company grows at about ten percent a year.  So if\\nyou\\'re running a big company and you do everything the way the\\naverage big company does it, you can expect to do as well as the\\naverage big company-- that is, to grow about ten percent a year.\\n\\nThe same thing will happen if you\\'re running a startup, of course.\\nIf you do everything the way the average startup does it, you should\\nexpect average performance.  The problem here is, average performance\\nmeans that you\\'ll go out of business.  The survival rate for startups\\nis way less than fifty percent.  So if you\\'re running a startup,\\nyou had better be doing something odd.  If not, you\\'re in trouble.\\n\\nBack in 1995, we knew something that I don\\'t think our competitors\\nunderstood, and few understand even now:  when you\\'re writing\\nsoftware that only has to run on your own servers, you can use\\nany language you want.  When you\\'re writing desktop software,\\nthere\\'s a strong bias toward writing applications in the same\\nlanguage as the operating system.  Ten years ago, writing applications\\nmeant writing applications in C.  But with Web-based software,\\nespecially when you have the source code of both the language and\\nthe operating system, you can use whatever language you want.\\n\\nThis new freedom is a double-edged sword, however.  Now that you\\ncan use any language, you have to think about which one to use.\\nCompanies that try to pretend nothing has changed risk finding that\\ntheir competitors do not.\\n\\nIf you can use any language, which do you use?  We chose Lisp.\\nFor one thing, it was obvious that rapid development would be\\nimportant in this market.  We were all starting from scratch, so\\na company that could get new features done before its competitors\\nwould have a big advantage.  We knew Lisp was a really good language\\nfor writing software quickly, and server-based applications magnify\\nthe effect of rapid development, because you can release software\\nthe minute it\\'s done.\\n\\nIf other companies didn\\'t want to use Lisp, so much the better.\\nIt might give us a technological edge, and we needed all the help\\nwe could get.  When we started Viaweb, we had no experience in\\nbusiness.  We didn\\'t know anything about marketing, or hiring\\npeople, or raising money, or getting customers.  Neither of us had\\never even had what you would call a real job.  The only thing we\\nwere good at was writing software.  We hoped that would save us.\\nAny advantage we could get in the software department, we would\\ntake.\\n\\nSo you could say that using Lisp was an experiment.  Our hypothesis\\nwas that if we wrote our software in Lisp, we\\'d be able to get\\nfeatures done faster than our competitors, and also to do things\\nin our software that they couldn\\'t do.  And because Lisp was so\\nhigh-level, we wouldn\\'t need a big development team, so our costs\\nwould be lower.  If this were so, we could offer a better product\\nfor less money, and still make a profit.  We would end up getting\\nall the users, and our competitors would get none, and eventually\\ngo out of business.  That was what we hoped would happen, anyway.\\n\\nWhat were the results of this experiment?  Somewhat surprisingly,\\nit worked.  We eventually had many competitors, on the order of\\ntwenty to thirty of them, but none of their software could compete\\nwith ours.  We had a wysiwyg online store builder that ran on the\\nserver and yet felt like a desktop application.  Our competitors\\nhad cgi scripts.  And we were always far ahead of them in features.\\nSometimes, in desperation, competitors would try to introduce\\nfeatures that we didn\\'t have.  But with Lisp our development cycle\\nwas so fast that we could sometimes duplicate a new feature within\\na day or two of a competitor announcing it in a press release.  By\\nthe time journalists covering the press release got round to calling\\nus, we would have the new feature too.\\n\\nIt must have seemed to our competitors that we had some kind of\\nsecret weapon-- that we were decoding their Enigma traffic or\\nsomething.  In fact we did have a secret weapon, but it was simpler\\nthan they realized.  No one was leaking news of their features to\\nus.   We were just able to develop software faster than anyone\\nthought possible.\\n\\nWhen I was about nine I happened to get hold of a copy of <i>The Day\\nof the Jackal,</i> by Frederick Forsyth.  The main character is an\\nassassin who is hired to kill the president of France.  The assassin\\nhas to get past the police to get up to an apartment that overlooks\\nthe president\\'s route.  He walks right by them, dressed up as an\\nold man on crutches, and they never suspect him.\\n\\nOur secret weapon was similar.  We wrote our software in a weird\\nAI language, with a bizarre syntax full of parentheses.  For years\\nit had annoyed me to hear Lisp described that way.  But now it\\nworked to our advantage.  In business, there is nothing more valuable\\nthan a technical advantage your competitors don\\'t understand.  In\\nbusiness, as in war, surprise is worth as much as force.\\n\\nAnd so, I\\'m a little embarrassed to say, I never said anything\\npublicly about Lisp while we were working on Viaweb.  We never\\nmentioned it to the press, and if you searched for Lisp on our Web\\nsite, all you\\'d find were the titles of two books in my bio.  This\\nwas no accident.  A startup should give its competitors as little\\ninformation as possible.  If they didn\\'t know what language our\\nsoftware was written in, or didn\\'t care, I wanted to keep it that\\nway.[2]\\n\\nThe people who understood our technology best were the customers.\\nThey didn\\'t care what language Viaweb was written in either, but\\nthey noticed that it worked really well.  It let them build great\\nlooking online stores literally in minutes.  And so, by word of\\nmouth mostly, we got more and more users.  By the end of 1996 we\\nhad about 70 stores online.  At the end of 1997 we had 500.  Six\\nmonths later, when Yahoo bought us, we had 1070 users.  Today, as\\nYahoo Store, this software continues to dominate its market.  It\\'s\\none of the more profitable pieces of Yahoo, and the stores built\\nwith it are the foundation of Yahoo Shopping.  I left Yahoo in\\n1999, so I don\\'t know exactly how many users they have now, but\\nthe last I heard there were about 20,000.\\n\\n<!-- People sometimes ask me if Yahoo Store still uses Lisp.  Yes, all\\nthe Lisp code is still there.  Yahoo has server-side software\\nwritten in all five of the languages Eric Raymond recommends to\\nhackers.\\n-->\\n<b>The Blub Paradox</b>\\n\\nWhat\\'s so great about Lisp?  And if Lisp is so great, why doesn\\'t\\neveryone use it?  These sound like rhetorical questions, but actually\\nthey have straightforward answers.  Lisp is so great not because\\nof some magic quality visible only to devotees, but because it is\\nsimply the most powerful language available.  And the reason everyone\\ndoesn\\'t use it is that programming languages are not merely\\ntechnologies, but habits of mind as well, and nothing changes\\nslower.  Of course, both these answers need explaining.\\n\\nI\\'ll begin with a shockingly controversial statement:  programming\\nlanguages vary in power.\\n\\nFew would dispute, at least, that high level languages are more\\npowerful than machine language.  Most programmers today would agree\\nthat you do not, ordinarily, want to program in machine language.\\nInstead, you should program in a high-level language, and have a\\ncompiler translate it into machine language for you.  This idea is\\neven built into the hardware now: since the 1980s, instruction sets\\nhave been designed for compilers rather than human programmers.\\n\\nEveryone knows it\\'s a mistake to write your whole program by hand\\nin machine language.  What\\'s less often understood is that there\\nis a more general principle here: that if you have a choice of\\nseveral languages, it is, all other things being equal, a mistake\\nto program in anything but the most powerful one. [3]\\n\\nThere are many exceptions to this rule.  If you\\'re writing a program\\nthat has to work very closely with a program written in a certain\\nlanguage, it might be a good idea to write the new program in the\\nsame language.  If you\\'re writing a program that only has to do\\nsomething very simple, like number crunching or bit manipulation,\\nyou may as well use a less abstract language, especially since it\\nmay be slightly faster.  And if you\\'re writing a short, throwaway\\nprogram, you may be better off just using whatever language has\\nthe best library functions for the task.  But in general, for\\napplication software, you want to be using the most powerful\\n(reasonably efficient) language you can get, and using anything\\nelse is a mistake, of exactly the same kind, though possibly in a\\nlesser degree, as programming in machine language.\\n\\nYou can see that machine language is very low level.  But, at least\\nas a kind of social convention, high-level languages are often all\\ntreated as equivalent.  They\\'re not.  Technically the term \"high-level\\nlanguage\" doesn\\'t mean anything very definite.  There\\'s no dividing\\nline with machine languages on one side and all the high-level\\nlanguages on the other.  Languages fall along a continuum [4] of\\nabstractness, from the most powerful all the way down to machine\\nlanguages, which themselves vary in power.\\n\\nConsider Cobol.  Cobol is a high-level language, in the sense that\\nit gets compiled into machine language.  Would anyone seriously\\nargue that Cobol is equivalent in power to, say, Python?  It\\'s\\nprobably closer to machine language than Python.\\n\\nOr how about Perl 4?  Between Perl 4 and Perl 5, lexical closures\\ngot added to the language.  Most Perl hackers would agree that Perl\\n5 is more powerful than Perl 4.  But once you\\'ve admitted that,\\nyou\\'ve admitted that one high level language can be more powerful\\nthan another.  And it follows inexorably that, except in special\\ncases, you ought to use the most powerful you can get.\\n\\nThis idea is rarely followed to its conclusion, though.  After a\\ncertain age, programmers rarely switch languages voluntarily.\\nWhatever language people happen to be used to, they tend to consider\\njust good enough.\\n\\nProgrammers get very attached to their favorite languages, and I\\ndon\\'t want to hurt anyone\\'s feelings, so to explain this point I\\'m\\ngoing to use a hypothetical language called Blub.  Blub falls right\\nin the middle of the abstractness continuum.  It is not the most\\npowerful language, but it is more powerful than Cobol or machine\\nlanguage.\\n\\nAnd in fact, our hypothetical Blub programmer wouldn\\'t use either\\nof them.  Of course he wouldn\\'t program in machine language.  That\\'s\\nwhat compilers are for.  And as for Cobol, he doesn\\'t know how\\nanyone can get anything done with it.  It doesn\\'t even have x (Blub\\nfeature of your choice).\\n\\nAs long as our hypothetical Blub programmer is looking down the\\npower continuum, he knows he\\'s looking down.  Languages less powerful\\nthan Blub are obviously less powerful, because they\\'re missing some\\nfeature he\\'s used to.  But when our hypothetical Blub programmer\\nlooks in the other direction, up the power continuum, he doesn\\'t\\nrealize he\\'s looking up.  What he sees are merely weird languages.\\nHe probably considers them about equivalent in power to Blub, but\\nwith all this other hairy stuff thrown in as well.  Blub is good\\nenough for him, because he thinks in Blub.\\n\\nWhen we switch to the point of view of a programmer using any of\\nthe languages higher up the power continuum, however, we find that\\nhe in turn looks down upon Blub.  How can you get anything done in\\nBlub? It doesn\\'t even have y.\\n\\nBy induction, the only programmers in a position to see all the\\ndifferences in power between the various languages are those who\\nunderstand the most powerful one.  (This is probably what Eric\\nRaymond meant about Lisp making you a better programmer.) You can\\'t\\ntrust the opinions of the others, because of the Blub paradox:\\nthey\\'re satisfied with whatever language they happen to use, because\\nit dictates the way they think about programs.\\n\\nI know this from my own experience, as a high school kid writing\\nprograms in Basic.  That language didn\\'t even support recursion.\\nIt\\'s hard to imagine writing programs without using recursion, but\\nI didn\\'t miss it at the time.  I thought in Basic.  And I was a\\nwhiz at it.  Master of all I surveyed.\\n\\nThe five languages that Eric Raymond recommends to hackers fall at\\nvarious points on the power continuum.  Where they fall relative\\nto one another is a sensitive topic.  What I will say is that I\\nthink Lisp is at the top.  And to support this claim I\\'ll tell you\\nabout one of the things I find missing when I look at the other\\nfour languages.  How can you get anything done in them, I think,\\nwithout macros? [5]\\n\\nMany languages have something called a macro.  But Lisp macros are\\nunique.  And believe it or not, what they do is related to the\\nparentheses.  The designers of Lisp didn\\'t put all those parentheses\\nin the language just to be different.  To the Blub programmer, Lisp\\ncode looks weird.  But those parentheses are there for a reason.\\nThey are the outward evidence of a fundamental difference between\\nLisp and other languages.\\n\\nLisp code is made out of Lisp data objects.  And not in the trivial\\nsense that the source files contain characters, and strings are\\none of the data types supported by the language.  Lisp code, after\\nit\\'s read by the parser, is made of data structures that you can\\ntraverse.\\n\\nIf you understand how compilers work, what\\'s really going on is\\nnot so much that Lisp has a strange syntax as that Lisp has no\\nsyntax.  You write programs in the parse trees that get generated\\nwithin the compiler when other languages are parsed.  But these\\nparse trees are fully accessible to your programs.  You can write\\nprograms that manipulate them.  In Lisp, these programs are called\\nmacros.  They are programs that write programs.\\n\\nPrograms that write programs?  When would you ever want to do that?\\nNot very often, if you think in Cobol.  All the time, if you think\\nin Lisp.  It would be convenient here if I could give an example\\nof a powerful macro, and say there! how about that?  But if I did,\\nit would just look like gibberish to someone who didn\\'t know Lisp;\\nthere isn\\'t room here to explain everything you\\'d need to know to\\nunderstand what it meant.  In \\n<a href=\"acl.html\">Ansi Common Lisp</a> I tried to move\\nthings along as fast as I could, and even so I didn\\'t get to macros\\nuntil page 160.\\n\\nBut I think I can give a kind of argument that might be convincing.\\nThe source code of the Viaweb editor was probably about 20-25%\\nmacros.  Macros are harder to write than ordinary Lisp functions,\\nand it\\'s considered to be bad style to use them when they\\'re not\\nnecessary.  So every macro in that code is there because it has to\\nbe.  What that means is that at least 20-25% of the code in this\\nprogram is doing things that you can\\'t easily do in any other\\nlanguage.  However skeptical the Blub programmer might be about my\\nclaims for the mysterious powers of Lisp, this ought to make him\\ncurious.  We weren\\'t writing this code for our own amusement.  We\\nwere a tiny startup, programming as hard as we could in order to\\nput technical barriers between us and our competitors.\\n\\nA suspicious person might begin to wonder if there was some\\ncorrelation here.  A big chunk of our code was doing things that\\nare very hard to do in other languages.  The resulting software\\ndid things our competitors\\' software couldn\\'t do.  Maybe there was\\nsome kind of connection.  I encourage you to follow that thread.\\nThere may be more to that old man hobbling along on his crutches\\nthan meets the eye.\\n\\n<b>Aikido for Startups</b>\\n\\nBut I don\\'t expect to convince anyone \\n(<a href=\"http://www.trollope.org/scheme.html\">over 25</a>) \\nto go out and learn\\nLisp.  The purpose of this article is not to change anyone\\'s mind,\\nbut to reassure people already interested in using Lisp-- people\\nwho know that Lisp is a powerful language, but worry because it\\nisn\\'t widely used.  In a competitive situation, that\\'s an advantage.\\nLisp\\'s power is multiplied by the fact that your competitors don\\'t\\nget it.\\n\\nIf you think of using Lisp in a startup, you shouldn\\'t worry that\\nit isn\\'t widely understood.  You should hope that it stays that\\nway. And it\\'s likely to.  It\\'s the nature of programming languages\\nto make most people satisfied with whatever they currently use.\\nComputer hardware changes so much faster than personal habits that\\nprogramming practice is usually ten to twenty years behind the\\nprocessor.  At places like MIT they were writing programs in\\nhigh-level languages in the early 1960s, but many companies continued\\nto write code in machine language well into the 1980s.  I bet a\\nlot of people continued to write machine language until the processor,\\nlike a bartender eager to close up and go home, finally kicked them\\nout by switching to a risc instruction set.\\n\\nOrdinarily technology changes fast.  But programming languages are\\ndifferent: programming languages are not just technology, but what\\nprogrammers think in.  They\\'re half technology and half religion.[6]\\nAnd so the median language, meaning whatever language the median\\nprogrammer uses, moves as slow as an iceberg.  Garbage collection,\\nintroduced by Lisp in about 1960, is now widely considered to be\\na good thing.  Runtime typing, ditto, is growing in popularity.\\nLexical closures, introduced by Lisp in the early 1970s, are now,\\njust barely, on the radar screen.  Macros, introduced by Lisp in the\\nmid 1960s, are still terra incognita.\\n\\nObviously, the median language has enormous momentum.  I\\'m not\\nproposing that you can fight this powerful force.  What I\\'m proposing\\nis exactly the opposite: that, like a practitioner of Aikido, you\\ncan use it against your opponents.\\n\\nIf you work for a big company, this may not be easy.  You will have\\na hard time convincing the pointy-haired boss to let you build\\nthings in Lisp, when he has just read in the paper that some other\\nlanguage is poised, like Ada was twenty years ago, to take over\\nthe world.  But if you work for a startup that doesn\\'t have\\npointy-haired bosses yet, you can, like we did, turn the Blub\\nparadox to your advantage:  you can use technology that your\\ncompetitors, glued immovably to the median language, will never be\\nable to match.\\n\\nIf you ever do find yourself working for a startup, here\\'s a handy\\ntip for evaluating competitors.  Read their job listings.  Everything\\nelse on their site may be stock photos or the prose equivalent,\\nbut the job listings have to be specific about what they want, or\\nthey\\'ll get the wrong candidates.\\n\\nDuring the years we worked on Viaweb I read a lot of job descriptions.\\nA new competitor seemed to emerge out of the woodwork every month\\nor so.  The first thing I would do, after checking to see if they\\nhad a live online demo, was look at their job listings.  After a\\ncouple years of this I could tell which companies to worry about\\nand which not to.  The more of an IT flavor the job descriptions\\nhad, the less dangerous the company was.  The safest kind were the\\nones that wanted Oracle experience.  You never had to worry about\\nthose.  You were also safe if they said they wanted C++ or Java\\ndevelopers.  If they wanted Perl or Python programmers, that would\\nbe a bit frightening-- that\\'s starting to sound like a company\\nwhere the technical side, at least, is run by real hackers.  If I\\nhad ever seen a job posting looking for Lisp hackers, I would have\\nbeen really worried.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n<b>Notes</b>\\n\\n[1] Viaweb at first had two parts: the editor, written in Lisp,\\nwhich people used to build their sites, and the ordering system,\\nwritten in C, which handled orders.  The first version was mostly\\nLisp, because the ordering system was small.  Later we added two\\nmore modules, an image generator written in C, and a back-office\\nmanager written mostly in Perl.\\n\\nIn January 2003, Yahoo released a new version of the editor \\nwritten in C++ and Perl.  It\\'s hard to say whether the program is no\\nlonger written in Lisp, though, because to translate this program\\ninto C++ they literally had to write a Lisp interpreter: the source\\nfiles of all the page-generating templates are still, as far as I\\nknow,  Lisp code.  (See <a href=\"quotes.html\">Greenspun\\'s Tenth Rule</a>.)\\n\\n[2] Robert Morris says that I didn\\'t need to be secretive, because\\neven if our competitors had known we were using Lisp, they wouldn\\'t\\nhave understood why:  \"If they were that smart they\\'d already be\\nprogramming in Lisp.\"\\n\\n[3] All languages are equally powerful in the sense of being Turing\\nequivalent, but that\\'s not the sense of the word programmers care\\nabout. (No one wants to program a Turing machine.)  The kind of\\npower programmers care about may not be formally definable, but\\none way to explain it would be to say that it refers to features\\nyou could only get in the less powerful language by writing an\\ninterpreter for the more powerful language in it. If language A\\nhas an operator for removing spaces from strings and language B\\ndoesn\\'t, that probably doesn\\'t make A more powerful, because you\\ncan probably write a subroutine to do it in B.  But if A supports,\\nsay, recursion, and B doesn\\'t, that\\'s not likely to be something\\nyou can fix by writing library functions.\\n\\n[4] Note to nerds: or possibly a lattice, narrowing toward the top;\\nit\\'s not the shape that matters here but the idea that there is at\\nleast a partial order.\\n\\n[5] It is a bit misleading to treat macros as a separate feature.\\nIn practice their usefulness is greatly enhanced by other Lisp\\nfeatures like lexical closures and rest parameters.\\n\\n[6] As a result, comparisons of programming languages either take\\nthe form of religious wars or undergraduate textbooks so determinedly\\nneutral that they\\'re really works of anthropology.  People who\\nvalue their peace, or want tenure, avoid the topic.  But the question\\nis only half a religious one; there is something there worth\\nstudying, especially if you want to design new languages.\\n<p align=justif>\\nAfter a link to \\n<a href=\"avg.html\">Beating the Averages</a> was posted on slashdot, \\nsome readers wanted to hear in more detail \\nabout the specific technical advantages we got from using\\nLisp in Viaweb.  For those who are interested,\\nhere are some excerpts from a talk I gave in April 2001 at\\nBBN Labs in Cambridge, MA.\\n1993\\n<p align=justif>\\n<i>(This essay is from the introduction to </i><a href=\"onlisp.html\">On Lisp</a>.<i>  The red text\\nexplains the origins of <a href=\"arc.html\">Arc</a>\\'s name.)</i>\\n\\nIt\\'s a long-standing principle of programming style that the functional\\nelements of a program should not be too large.  If some component of a\\nprogram grows beyond the stage where it\\'s readily comprehensible,\\nit becomes a mass of complexity which conceals errors as easily\\nas a big city conceals fugitives.  Such software will be\\nhard to read, hard to test, and hard to debug.\\n\\nIn accordance with this principle, a large program must be divided\\ninto pieces, and the larger the program, the more it must be divided.\\nHow do you divide a program?  The traditional approach is\\ncalled <i>top-down design:</i> you say \"the purpose of the\\nprogram is to do these seven things, so I divide it into seven major\\nsubroutines.  The first subroutine has to do these four things, so\\nit in turn will have four of its own subroutines,\" and so on.\\nThis process continues until the whole program has the right level\\nof granularity-- each part large enough to do something substantial,\\nbut small enough to be understood as a single unit.\\n\\nExperienced Lisp programmers divide up their programs differently.\\nAs well as top-down design, they follow a principle which\\ncould be called <i>bottom-up design</i>-- changing the language\\nto suit the problem.\\nIn Lisp, you don\\'t just write your program down toward the language,\\nyou also build the language up toward your program.  As you\\'re\\nwriting a program you may think \"I wish Lisp had such-and-such an\\noperator.\" So you go and write it. Afterward\\nyou realize that using the new operator would simplify the design  \\nof another part of the program, and so on.\\nLanguage and program evolve together.\\nLike the border between two warring states,\\nthe boundary between language and program is drawn and redrawn,\\nuntil eventually it comes to rest along the mountains and rivers,\\nthe natural frontiers of your problem.\\nIn the end your program will look as if the language had been\\ndesigned for it.\\nAnd when language and\\nprogram fit one another well, you end up with code which is\\nclear, small, and efficient.\\n\\n<font color=#880000>\\nIt\\'s worth emphasizing that bottom-up design doesn\\'t mean\\njust writing the same program in a different order.  When you\\nwork bottom-up, you usually end up with a different program.\\nInstead of a single, monolithic program,\\nyou will get a larger language with more abstract operators,   \\nand a smaller program written in it.  Instead of a lintel,\\nyou\\'ll get an arch.\\n</font>\\n\\nIn typical code, once you abstract out the parts which are\\nmerely bookkeeping, what\\'s left is much shorter;\\nthe higher you build up the language, the less distance you\\nwill have to travel from the top down to it.\\nThis brings several advantages:\\n\\n<ol>\\n<li> By making the language do more of the work, bottom-up design\\nyields programs which are smaller and more agile.  A shorter\\nprogram doesn\\'t have to be divided into so many components, and\\nfewer components means programs which are easier to read or\\nmodify.  Fewer components also means fewer connections between   \\ncomponents, and thus less chance for errors there.  As\\nindustrial designers strive to reduce the number of moving parts\\nin a machine, experienced Lisp programmers use bottom-up design\\nto reduce the size and complexity of their programs.\\n\\n<li> Bottom-up design promotes code re-use.\\nWhen you write two\\nor more programs, many of the utilities you wrote for the first\\nprogram will also be useful in the succeeding ones.  Once you\\'ve  \\nacquired a large substrate of utilities, writing a new program can\\ntake only a fraction of the effort it would require if you had to \\nstart with raw Lisp.\\n\\n<li> Bottom-up design makes programs easier to read.\\n<!--\\n%It yields the same result as top-down design\\n%with foresight---the foresight to arrange the branches near the\\n%root of the tree so that among the leaves there is as little\\n%duplication of effort as possible.\\n-->\\nAn instance of this type\\nof abstraction asks the reader to understand a general-purpose operator;\\nan instance of functional abstraction asks the reader to understand\\na special-purpose subroutine. [1]\\n\\n<li> Because it causes you always to be on the lookout for patterns\\nin your code, working bottom-up helps to clarify your ideas about\\nthe design of your program.  If two distant components of a program\\nare similar in form, you\\'ll be led to notice the similarity and\\nperhaps to redesign the program in a simpler way.\\n</ol>\\n<p align=justif>\\nBottom-up design is possible to a certain degree in languages\\nother than Lisp.  Whenever you see library functions,\\nbottom-up design is happening.  However, Lisp gives you much broader\\npowers in this department, and augmenting the language plays a\\nproportionately larger role in Lisp style-- so much so that\\nLisp is not just a different language, but a whole different way\\nof programming.\\n\\nIt\\'s true that this style of development is better suited to\\nprograms which can be written by small groups.  However, at the\\nsame time, it extends the limits of what can be done by a small\\ngroup.  In <i>The Mythical Man-Month</i>,\\nFrederick Brooks\\nproposed that the productivity of a group of programmers\\ndoes not grow linearly with its size.  As the size of the\\ngroup increases, the productivity of individual programmers\\ngoes down.  The experience of Lisp programming  \\nsuggests a more cheerful way\\nto phrase this law: as the size of the group decreases, the\\nproductivity of individual programmers goes up.\\nA small group wins, relatively speaking, simply because it\\'s\\nsmaller.  When a small group also takes advantage of the\\ntechniques that Lisp makes possible, it can \\n<a href=\"avg.html\">win outright</a>.\\n\\n\\n\\n<b>New:</b> <a href=\"onlisptext.html\">Download On Lisp for Free</a>.\\n\\n\\n\\n<hr>\\n\\n\\n[1] \"But no one can read\\nthe program without understanding all your new utilities.\"\\nTo see why such statements are usually mistaken,\\nsee Section 4.8.\\n'"

That territory tends to be picked\\nclean, precisely because those insights are so valuable.\\n\\nOrdinarily, the best that people can do is one without the\\nother: either surprising without being general (e.g.\\ngossip), or general without being surprising (e.g.\\nplatitudes).\\n\\nWhere things get interesting is the moderately valuable\\ninsights.  You get those from small additions of whichever\\nquality was missing.  The more common case is a small\\naddition of generality: a piece of gossip that\\'s more than\\njust gossip, because it teaches something interesting about\\nthe world. But another less common approach is to focus on\\nthe most general ideas and see if you can find something new\\nto say about them. Because these start out so general, you\\nonly need a small delta of novelty to produce a useful\\ninsight.\\n\\nA small delta of novelty is all you\\'ll be able to get most\\nof the time. Which means if you take this route your ideas\\nwill seem a lot like ones that already exist. Sometimes\\nyou\\'ll find you\\'ve merely rediscovered an idea that did\\nalready exist.  But don\\'t be discouraged.  Remember the huge\\nmultiplier that kicks in when you do manage to think of\\nsomething even a little new.\\n\\nCorollary: the more general the ideas you\\'re talking about,\\nthe less you should worry about repeating yourself.  If you\\nwrite enough, it\\'s inevitable you will.  Your brain is much\\nthe same from year to year and so are the stimuli that hit\\nit. I feel slightly bad when I find I\\'ve said something\\nclose to what I\\'ve said before, as if I were plagiarizing\\nmyself. But rationally one shouldn\\'t.  You won\\'t say\\nsomething exactly the same way the second time, and that\\nvariation increases the chance you\\'ll get that tiny but\\ncritical delta of novelty.\\n\\nAnd of course, ideas beget ideas.  (That sounds familiar.)\\nAn idea with a small amount of novelty could lead to one\\nwith more. But only if you keep going. So it\\'s doubly\\nimportant not to let yourself be discouraged by people who\\nsay there\\'s not much new about something you\\'ve discovered.\\n\"Not much new\" is a real achievement when you\\'re talking\\nabout the most general ideas. Maybe if you keep going,\\nyou\\'ll discover more.\\n\\nIt\\'s not true that there\\'s nothing new under the sun.  There\\nare some domains where there\\'s almost nothing new.  But\\nthere\\'s a big difference between nothing and almost nothing,\\nwhen it\\'s multiplied by the area under the sun.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n<b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman, Patrick Collison, and Jessica\\nLivingston for reading drafts of this.\\nJanuary 2017\\n\\nPeople who are powerful but uncharismatic will tend to be disliked.\\nTheir power makes them a target for criticism that they don\\'t have\\nthe charisma to disarm. That was Hillary Clinton\\'s problem. It also\\ntends to be a problem for any CEO who is more of a builder than a\\nschmoozer. And yet the builder-type CEO is (like Hillary) probably\\nthe best person for the job.\\n\\nI don\\'t think there is any solution to this problem. It\\'s human\\nnature. The best we can do is to recognize that it\\'s happening, and\\nto understand that being a magnet for criticism is sometimes a sign\\nnot that someone is the wrong person for a job, but that they\\'re\\nthe right one.\\nJanuary 2017\\n\\nBecause biographies of famous scientists tend to \\nedit out their mistakes, we underestimate the \\ndegree of risk they were willing to take.\\nAnd because anything a famous scientist did that\\nwasn\\'t a mistake has probably now become the\\nconventional wisdom, those choices don\\'t\\nseem risky either.\\n\\nBiographies of Newton, for example, understandably focus\\nmore on physics than alchemy or theology.\\nThe impression we get is that his unerring judgment\\nled him straight to truths no one else had noticed.\\nHow to explain all the time he spent on alchemy\\nand theology?  Well, smart people are often kind of\\ncrazy.\\n\\nBut maybe there is a simpler explanation. Maybe\\nthe smartness and the craziness were not as separate\\nas we think. Physics seems to us a promising thing\\nto work on, and alchemy and theology obvious wastes\\nof time. But that\\'s because we know how things\\nturned out. In Newton\\'s day the three problems \\nseemed roughly equally promising. No one knew yet\\nwhat the payoff would be for inventing what we\\nnow call physics; if they had, more people would \\nhave been working on it.
